            <h1>Required Reports &amp; Presentations</h1>
            <p>An important part of the ENGG 390 experience is
reporting orally and in writing on your work. This document explains
the oral presentations and written reports you will be required to
make. The class has a schedule for delivering Proposals and Final
Presentations. Final Presentations are made before
a review board of professors and industry professionals. </p>
            <h2 class="padding">Example Schedule</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Pre-proposal in the term prior to internship/project.</li>
              <li>Full Proposal after 1-2 weeks of the internship.</li>
              <li>Two Progress Reports during the internship, emailed
to the instructors.  Additional Progress Reports may be needed depending on the length of the internship.</li>
              <li>Electronic copy of the Final Report, Project Abstract, Project Executive Summary emailed to M.E.M. Assistant Director approximately 2 weeks before fall term.</li>
              <li>At least one practice presentation shortly before the
Final Presentation.</li>
              <li>Final Presentation and Hard Copy Final Report at the beginning of the
term following the internship.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="padding">Pre-proposal</h2>
            <p><b>What?</b> The student must meet with one of the
instructors to discuss their internship/project and provide a one-page
description of their internship/project.<br>
            </p>
            <p><b>When?</b> During the term before the
project/internship is undertaken</p>
            <h2 class="padding">Proposal</h2>
            <p><b>What?</b> A written report. Proposals usually contain an agreement of the
sponsor to support the work. The substance of the proposal includes: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>a definition of the problem</li>
              <li>quantitative specifications describing the functions
to be performed</li>
              <li>a description of the design approach</li>
              <li>a timeline of activities</li>
              <li>a statement of expected results and deliverables</li>
              <li>measures of success</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and any other information that can help assess the
viability of the project.</p>
            <p><b>When?</b> One to two weeks after beginning your internship.  The Proposal should be emailed directly to one of the course instructors.</p>

            <h2 class="padding">1st and 2nd Progress Reports</h2>
            <p><b>What?</b> Written reports submitted to one of the
instructors (email is acceptable). Typically two progress reports are made
during the course of the work. If there are difficulties, uncertainties
or great successes, either anticipated or encountered, it may be
advisable to schedule additional progress reports. </p>
            <p>The first progress report usually contains a
reassessment of the problem and the approach being taken in the light
of experience. It should establish that the work is on track, the
objectives are clear, and that there is reasonable expectation of
success. Any difficulties, limitations, or changes in scope should be
identified at this stage. </p>
            <p>By the second progress report, enough results should
have been achieved to anticipate the end of the project with some
confidence. You should be able to describe what needs to be done to
finish the work. </p>
            
            <p><b>When?</b> On dates specified in your project timeline.</p>
            <h2 class="padding">Electronic Final Report, Abstract, Executive Summary</h2>

<p><b>What?</b> The written report should be a quality document that will impress the sponsor, the advisor, and the course instructor(s). It should clearly describe how the results meet the objectives that were defined at the start of the work. You must also submit to the Registrar an electronic copy of your abstract and a project form. 
</p>
<p><b>When?</b> All three documents should be submitted by email to the M.E.M. Assistant Director approximately one week prior to the beginning of the classes (see <a href="dates.shtml">Important Dates</a>).   The course instructor and your faculty advisor should also receive a copy of the Electronic Final Report at this time.
</p>
            <h2 class="padding">Hard Copy Final Report and Oral Presentation</h2>
            <p><b>What?</b> You will need to produce five hard copies of your Final Report.  Three will be handed in to the M.E.M. Program Assistant Director (M.E.M. Program Copy, Course Instructor, Thayer Registrar) and two you are responsible for getting to your faculty advisor and corporate sponsor. </p>

<p>The Oral Presentation is a 30 minute presentation in front of a review board comprised of faculty and industry experts.  Following the presentation there will be a 20 minute Q&amp;A section. The sponsor should be invited to attend the oral presentation and comment on how well the results meet his/her needs.</p>
            <p><b>When?</b> The hardcopies are typically due the first day of classes following the term in which you completed the internship.  Oral presentation are typically scheduled during the first two weeks of school follow the term in which you completed your internship.</p>
            <p><b>How will I be evaluated?</b> </p>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="mem-390-final-presentation.pdf">ENGG 390 Final Oral Presentation Evaluation (PDF)</a></li>
<li><a href="mem-390-final-report.pdf">ENGG 390 Final Written Report Evaluation (PDF)</a></li>
</ul>
            <p>The instructors will take into account the evaluations of the review board members and your faculty advisor when giving a grade. The instructors will additionally consider written feedback provided by your sponsor.</p>
            <h2 class="padding">Sponsor Evaluation</h2>
            <p>At the conclusion of the project, the student should ask
their sponsor to send a written evaluation of their work to one of the
instructors. The sponsor can fill out the <a
 href="mem-390-final-presentation.pdf">sponsor evaluation form (PDF)</a> and/or send a free-form
evaluation in the form of a letter. </p>
