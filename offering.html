			<h1>Offering an ENGG 390 Project</h1>
			<p>The support of industry professionals, especially through project sponsorship, greatly enhances the educational experience for M.E.M. students. If you are interested in sponsoring an M.E.M. internship/project, please contact the program director:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Geoffrey.G.Parker@dartmouth.edu">Geoffrey.G.Parker@dartmouth.edu</a></p>
			<p>Typical process for offering a project/internship:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Correspond with the M.E.M. Program Office to make sure your internship/project seems suitable for ENGG 390.</li>
				<li>Obtain details on accessing the M.E.M. Program's online internship resume book, which contains information on students seeking M.E.M. internships/projects. There you will find each student's resume, areas of interest, location preference, expected graduation date, and statement of desired internship/project topic.</li>
				<li>Proactively contact any students you identify from the online resume book who would be a good fit for your project.</li>
				<li>Email one of the directors a short description of your project, which will be posted for M.E.M. students.</li>
				<li>Review resumes and cover letters of students interested in your internship/project (which will be collected and sent to you).</li>
				<li>Interview students (either at Dartmouth, at your location, or by phone).</li>
				<li>Extend an offer to the student who would be the best fit for your internship/project.</li>
			</ul>
